# OddTicketOneHTML

Adjusted HTML to not be full of div soup and have a more clear understanding on how everything is set up on the page itself. Added descriptions to the images to make it more user friendly when using accessibility. Added a logo to the tab to make it more personalized. Also organized code more in CSS. Added comments on both the HTML and CSS.
